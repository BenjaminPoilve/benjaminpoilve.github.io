## **Flexdown**
##### @benjaminpoilve

Flexdown is an extension of the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax to allow some basic layout/responsivity. It automatically generate HTML code from a slightly extended Markdown file.

The layout capabilities uses the [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) CSS norm. The layout is akin to Bootstrap, with a small, medium and big size, which is defined per block by the user, using a `[big/medium/small]` syntax at the beginning of each block.

From a usage perspective, I borrowed @oscarmorrison 's idea (and some of it's implementation) to directly transform the Markdown file to html with a .js file in the user's browser. You can see this project [here](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page)

This website has been made with it, with my custom CSS

#### Caveat

There is a major caveat with client-side generation of HTML: it won’t work with Javascript disabled. There is, understandably, a significant proportion of privacy-minded folks that prefer not to allow random website to execute code on their machine. It was not something that I had in mind when designing this system and as a result my website isn’t readable for those people. 

This is something I intent to fix if I find the time (with a pre-rendering phase before publication).

### **Hello**,
#### I am @benjaminpoilve :raising_hand_man:

#### I am both an Engineer :triangular_ruler:  (I graduated from the [Ecole Centrale Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Centrale_Paris)) and a Designer :paintbrush: (I studied at the [ENSCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_de_cr%C3%A9ation_industrielle)).

#### But I am also a Data Scientist :computer:, who uses Python, Pandas and a whole lot of other tools to solve real-world problems (sometimes [for the hell of it](/projects/ratp-map.html)!)
#### But I am also a Maker :hammer_and_wrench:, who probably built every imaginable version of pen plotter ([regular](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/Liplo), [hole-punching](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/WKP), [with milk](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/milkPrinter)), knows electronics prototyping as well as PCB design.
#### But I am also a Entrepreneur, who co-founded the first [French Hacker-House](https://www.seed-up.io) :house_with_garden:, an adventure that had me led project for the biggest French compagnies with the weirdest team I had the chance to assemble, working for [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr), [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/), [NoDesign](https://www.nodesign.net/), [Hermes](https://www.hermes.com/)..

#### I now work for the [CNIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_nationale_de_l%27informatique_et_des_libert%C3%A9s) helping protect French citizen privacy.

#### You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MacDown-Resume-CSS/raw/master/demo/CV.pdf).
